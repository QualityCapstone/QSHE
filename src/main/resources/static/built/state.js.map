Fill the value with a translation.\r\n *\r\n * Empty string means no translation, so default \"Internationtional English\"\r\n * will beused.\r\n *\r\n * IMPORTANT:\r\n * When translating make good effort to keep the translation length\r\n * at least the same chartcount as the English, especially for short prompts.\r\n *\r\n * Having significantly longer prompts may distort the actual charts.\r\n *\r\n * NOTE:\r\n * Some prompts - like months or weekdays - come in two versions: full and\r\n * shortened.\r\n *\r\n * If there's no official shortened version of these in your language, and it\r\n * would not be possible to invent such short versions that don't seem weird\r\n * to native speakers of that language, fill those with the same as full\r\n * version.\r\n *\r\n * PLACEHODERS:\r\n * Some prompts have placeholders like \"%1\". Those will be replaced by actual\r\n * values during translation and should be retained in the translated prompts.\r\n *\r\n * Placeholder positions may be changed to better suit structure of the\r\n * sentence.\r\n *\r\n * For example \"From %1 to %2\", when actually used will replace \"%1\" with an\r\n * actual value representing range start, and \"%2\" will be replaced by end\r\n * value.\r\n *\r\n * E.g. in a Scrollbar for Value axis \"From %1 to %2\" will become\r\n * \"From 100 to 200\".
